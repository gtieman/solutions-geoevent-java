# Geometry Processors

The Geometry Processors demonstrate how to extend GeoEvent Processor to build custom processors that perform actions and processing on the geometries of a GeoEvent Service.

## Features 

Multiple processors are included with the Geometry Processors:

* Buffer Processor - Converts the GeoEvent geometry to a buffer around the incoming event.
* Ellipse Processor - Converts the GeoEvent geometry to an ellipse centered on the incoming event geometry.
* Range Fan Processor - Converts the GeoEvent geometry to a range fan with an origin at the incoming event geometry.
* Visibility Processor - Generates a viewshed with an observer located at the incoming GeoEvent geometry.  The Visibility Processor also allows the user to clip the viewshed to a polygon.
* Query Report Processor - Executes a spatial query on feature services registered in GeoEvent Processor's data store.  The author of the service can then configures a report based on returned features.

## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../README.md#requirements).
* The ArcGIS Runtime for Java SDK is required in order to run the standalone Maven Tests included with this project.

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of GeoEvent Processor and GeoEvent Processor SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
* Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/processors/geometry-processor`
    * Enter `mvn install` at the prompt.

## Installation

* Install the Geometry Processors.
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-processors/geometry-processor/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the .jar file and paste it into the deploy folder in the GeoEvent Processor install directory ([GeoEvent Processor install location]\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy).
* Check for existing GeoEvent Definitions.
    *  Open GeoEvent Processor Manager.
    *  Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘GeoEvent Processor’ > ‘GeoEvent Definitions’.
    *  Confirm GeoEvent Definition(s) exist for the processor(s) you want to run (e.g. if you are going to run the Buffer Processor, confirm a GeoEvent Definition is available as illustrated below).

* If these GeoEvent Definitions are not available, do the following to create these GeoEvent Definitions.
    *  Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘GeoEvent Processor’ > ‘Configuration Store’ and click ‘Import Configuration’.
    *  Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java\data\configurations` and locate the `GeoEventDefinitions-GeometryProcessors.xml` configuration file. This file is located [here](../../../data/configurations/GeoEventDefinitions-GeometryProcessors.xml).
    *  On the Import Configuration dialog, click Import.

## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).
    * Ensure the Buffer, Ellipse, Range Fan, Visibility, Query Report, etc. processors exist.

### Testing with Simulated Test Data

* In the following steps you will configure GeoEvent Processor to receive and process simulated data.
* The following example configures the Ran Fan Processor, the other processors can be configured in a similar manner.

* Open GeoEvent Processor Manager.
* Create an Input Connector to receive simulated data over TCP.
    * Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘Services’ > 'Inputs'.
    * Click Add Input and select 'Receive text from a TCP Socket' and configure as illustrated below.

* Next, create an Output Connector to observe the received data.
    * Navigate to ‘Site’ > ‘Services’ > 'Outputs'.
    * Select Add Input and select 'Write to a .csv file' and configure the properties.
* Create a simple GeoEvent Service to direct the input data to the output using the selected processor.
    * An example GeoEvent Service and processor configuration is illustrated below.

![Image of processor](doc/geometry-range-fan-service-design.png)

* In GeoEvent Processor Manager, navigate to ‘Services’ > ‘Monitor’ and observe the GeoEvent Processor components, they should be similar to the illustration below (note: your names/outputs may differ).

![Image of monitor](doc/monitor.png)

* Using the GeoEvent Simulator, load the simulation file located at  solutions-geoevent-java\data\simulation_files\Geometry-RangeFans.csv
* In GeoEvent Processor Manager, navigate to 'Services' > 'Monitor' to observe that the values are increasing and the selected outputs are updated. 
* You can now test the processors with additional outputs such as published feature services.
