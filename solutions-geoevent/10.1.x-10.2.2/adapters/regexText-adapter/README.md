# regexText Adapter

The regexText Adapter extends the out-of-the-box Text Adapter by enabling it to handle more complex Attribute Separators that can be defined using a (Java) Regular Expression.  It intercepts the input stream, replaces all matches of the Regular Expression with a simple, single-character, attribute separator, then passes the stream to the Text Adapter for processing as normal.
A good example of where it can be useful is where "any amount of white space" is used as a delimiter, as in this file of latest BUOY observations: http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/data/latest_obs/latest_obs.txt.

## Features

* Handles delimited text input, where the delimiter is complex and can be defined by a Regular Expression (Java)
* Converts all matches of the Regular Expression in the incoming text into a single-character delimiter (e.g. a comma, but this is configurable)
* Care should be taken to ensure that the single-character delimiter does not already exist in the data
* Passes the adapted incoming text to the base implementation of the out-of-the-box Text Adapter for processing as normal

## Requirements

* See common [solutions-geoevent-java requirements](../../../README.md#requirements)
* There are no additional requirements for this project

## Building 

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java instructions](../../../README.md#instructions) for general instructions on 
    * verifying your Maven installation
    * setting the location of the GeoEvent Processor and GeoEvent Processor SDK repositories
    * and any other common required steps
 * Open a command prompt and navigate to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/regexText-adapter
* Enter `mvn install` at the prompt

## Installation

* Install the adapter
    * Browse to `solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent/adapters/regexText-adapter/target` (this directory is created when you execute mvn install).
    * Copy the geomessage-adapter-{version}.jar file and paste it into the deploy folder in the GeoEvent Processor install directory ([GeoEvent Processor install location]\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy).
    * Open the GeoEvent Processor Manager web application and ensure that the regexText Adapter is present on the 'Site' > 'Components' > 'Adapters' page.

## Testing

### Validating the Installation
 
* See the [solutions-geoevent-java validation instructions](../../../README.md#validating-install).

### Testing with Live Data

* This adapter can be tested with weather data reported from Buoys in our oceans and seas.

* See the [solutions-geoevent-java/data/weather import instructions](../../../data/weather/README.md).
