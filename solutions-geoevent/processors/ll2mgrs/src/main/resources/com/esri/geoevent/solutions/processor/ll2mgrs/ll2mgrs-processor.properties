LBL_GEO_FLD=Geometry Field
DESC_GEO_FLD=Name of the field containing the point geometry to be converted to MGRS
LBL_NEW_DEF=GeoEvent Definition
DESC_NEW_DEF=Name of the GeoEvent Definition that is created by the processor
LBL_ACCURACY=Accuracy
DESC_ACCURACY=A digit (1-5) indicating the level of accuracy returned in the MGRS coordinate.
LBL_OVERWRITE=Overwrite Geometry
DESC_OVERWRITE=Overwrite current geometry with geometry generated by the processor
LBL_MGRS=MGRS field
DESC_MGRS=Field on the incoming GeoEvent containing the MGRS coordinate
LBL_BB=Return Bounding Box
DESC_BB=Returns an envelope calculated using the south west corner of MGRS zone in meters based on accuracy (not necessarily the bounding the bounding box of mgrs zone);
