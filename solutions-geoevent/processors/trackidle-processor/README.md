## Requirements

* ArcGIS GeoEvent Processor (GEP) for Server
* ArcGIS Geoevent Server Software Development Kit (SDK) - the SDK is included with the Geoevent Server installation
* Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 or greater
* [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org) (you may follow the GES SDK documentation to learn how to set up a Maven repository)
* Notes on individual projects
    * Individual projects may have additional requirements. See the Readme for [each project](#features) for more information.
    * Some project have a dependency on the ArcGIS Runtime for Java SDK in order to run standalone Maven Tests. See the Readme for [each project](#features) for more information.

## Instructions

### General Help

* [New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

### Building All Adapters and Processors
 
* Verify that Maven is installed and working correctly
    * From a command prompt, type `mvn -version` and verify that it returns the version correctly
    * If the Maven version is not returned correctly, consult the GEP SDK Developer Guide for more information on how to set up Maven. 
* Make any necessary changes to the pom.xml files to reflect the location of the GEP Server and GEP SDK repositories
    * If necessary, change the locations for the repository entries in the pom.xml 
    * The current settings assume these will be located at 
        * /Program Files/ArcGIS/Server/GeoEventProcessor/sdk/repository
        * /Program Files/ArcGIS/Server/GeoEventProcessor/system
* Depending on the version of software you have installed, you may also need to change the version property in the pom.xml files
* From a command prompt go to the `./solutions-geoevent-java/solutions-geoevent` directory
* Type `mvn install` at the prompt and hit return
* Each installed module will now have a target folder (see each module's Readme.md for the exact path)
* Browse to each target directory 
* Copy the .jar file from the target folder and paste it into the deploy directory on your GEP installation (ex. <GEP install location>\deploy\ -- default location is C:\Program Files\ArcGIS\Server\GeoEventProcessor\deploy)
 
### Validating Install
 
* Open the GeoEvent Processor Manager 
* Navigate to 'Site' > 'Components' >  'Adapters'
    *  You should see each newly installed adapter as one of the available adapters
* Navigate to 'Site' > 'Components' >  'Processors' 
    * You should see each newly installed processor as one of the available processors
